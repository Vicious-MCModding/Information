# Information
Information for people wondering what this place is.
# Who are we?
We are a bunch of java devs, mostly focused on creating minecraft content.

# What are you allowed to do with our projects?
Any project we make public you have full permission to fork, or contribute to.
You are fully welcome to copy segments of code to use in your own projects however, copying entire files (class or otherwise) is questionable behavior at best. If you need to use large amounts of our work in your own projects, the best way to do so is to include our projects as a dependency.

As a general rule, if you don't want to get yelled at for plagiarism, your best bet is to credit the original author (in this case Vicious) or just not copy at all. We won't actively hunt people down but there's always a possibility someone will notice.

We do not give permission to anyone to host our files elsewhere. The only place you should be getting Vicious programs and libraries from is this organization or the following trusted sites: CurseForge (curseforge.com)
We will take action if files are posted elsewhere as this puts other people at risk at downloading a virus (looking at you 9minecraft) Again, reposting software wthout permission is not an indicator of respect for its creators, its an indicator of either blatant stealing or possible predator behavior.
